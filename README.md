# Serpent

This is just a playground for code that let's you create (or use) a python virtual environment, and then use that environment to run a python script.

It's definitely not ready for prime time, but it does work at this point - just needs a bit of love.

If there is any interest in having this as a published project, let me know with an issue or something.
